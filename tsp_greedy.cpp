// Example Input
// Enter the number of cities: 4
// Enter the distance matrix (use a large value for no direct edge, e.g., 1e9):
// 0 10 15 20
// 10 0 35 25
// 15 35 0 30
// 20 25 30 0

// Time Complexity:
// O(nÂ²): The algorithm visits each city once, and for each city, it finds the minimum cost edge among unvisited cities.
// Space Complexity:
// O(n): To store the visited cities and the current state.


// Algorithm
// Start at an Initial City: Select any city as the starting point (e.g., city 0).
// Visit the Nearest Unvisited City: From the current city, choose the nearest city that hasn't been visited yet (based on minimum distance).
// Mark the City as Visited: Add the chosen city to the tour and mark it as visited.
// Repeat Until All Cities Are Visited: Continue the process until all cities have been visited.
// Return to the Starting City: Once all cities are visited, return to the starting city to complete the tour.
